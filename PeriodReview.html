    <h1>Trends in the Periodic Table – Review Answer Key</h1>
    <p class="intro">
      This key covers atomic radius, ionization energy, and the reactivity of
      metals in single-replacement reactions and in acid.
    </p>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>Part 1 – Atomic Radius</h2>

      <div>
        <h3>1. Calcium vs. Scandium and Strontium</h3>
        <p class="question">
          a) Would the radius of scandium be bigger or smaller than calcium?
        </p>
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Smaller.</p>
        <p>
          Across a period, nuclear charge increases and radius decreases, so Sc
          is smaller than Ca.
        </p>

        <p class="question">
          b) Would the radius of strontium be bigger or smaller than calcium?
        </p>
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Bigger.</p>
        <p>
          Down a group there are more energy levels, so atomic radius
          increases.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h3>2. Lithium vs. Beryllium</h3>
        <p>
          Atomic radii: Li = 145 pm, Be = 112 pm. Draw Bohr diagrams and use
          them to explain.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Key ideas:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Both Li and Be have 2 electron shells.</li>
          <li>Li has 1 valence electron (2,1); Be has 2 valence electrons (2,2).</li>
          <li>
            Be has a higher nuclear charge (more protons) pulling the electrons
            closer.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Be has a smaller radius because its
          stronger nuclear attraction pulls the same number of shells closer to
          the nucleus.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h3>3. Fluorine vs. Chlorine</h3>
        <p>
          Atomic radii: F = 73 pm, Cl = 99 pm. Draw Bohr diagrams and explain.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>F and Cl are in the same group (halogens).</li>
          <li>Cl has one more energy level than F.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Because Cl has an extra shell, its electrons are farther from the
          nucleus, so its atomic radius is larger than F.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h3>4. Fe, Co, Ni Radii</h3>
        <p>Atomic radii: Fe = 126 pm, Co = 125 pm, Ni = 124 pm.</p>
        <p class="question">
          a) Electron configurations in core notation and explanation.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Fe: <code>[Ar] 4s² 3d⁶</code></li>
          <li>Co: <code>[Ar] 4s² 3d⁷</code></li>
          <li>Ni: <code>[Ar] 4s² 3d⁸</code></li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Electrons are being added to the same 3d sublevel. Shielding changes
          very little, so the effective nuclear charge increases only slightly.
          This causes only a very small decrease in atomic radius across Fe → Co
          → Ni.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h3>5. Ni, Cu, Zn Radii</h3>
        <p>Atomic radii: Ni = 124 pm, Cu = 128 pm, Zn = 138 pm.</p>
        <p class="question">
          a) Electron configurations in core notation and explanation.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Ni: <code>[Ar] 4s² 3d⁸</code></li>
          <li>Cu: <code>[Ar] 4s¹ 3d¹⁰</code></li>
          <li>Zn: <code>[Ar] 4s² 3d¹⁰</code></li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Trend-wise, the radius is expected to keep decreasing across the
          period. Instead it increases from Ni → Cu → Zn because once the 3d
          sublevel is full, additional electrons and protons change shielding
          and electron–electron repulsions. The filled 3d shell shields the
          4s electrons more effectively, allowing the outer electrons to be held
          less tightly and increasing the radius.

      <h2>Part 1 – Ionization Energy</h2>

      <div>
        <h3>1. Sodium vs. Magnesium and Potassium</h3>
        <p>Ionization energy (IE) of Na = 5.12 eV.</p>
        <p class="question">
          a) Would IE of Mg be higher or lower than Na?
        </p>
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Higher.</p>
        <p>
          Mg has a higher nuclear charge and a smaller radius than Na, so it
          holds its valence electrons more strongly.
        </p>

        <p class="question">
          b) Would IE of K be higher or lower than Na?
        </p>
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Lower.</p>
        <p>
          K is below Na in the same group and has an extra energy level, so its
          outer electron is farther from the nucleus and easier to remove.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h3>2. Magnesium vs. Aluminum</h3>
        <p>IE of Mg = 7.61 eV; IE of Al = 5.95 eV.</p>
        <p class="question">
          a) Based on the general trend, should IE of Al be higher or lower than
          Mg?
        </p>
        <p><strong>Trend prediction:</strong> Al should be higher (to the right of Mg).</p>

        <p class="question">b) Explain the actual numbers.</p>
        <p>
          In reality, Al has the lower IE. This is because the electron removed
          from Al is a 3p¹ electron, which is higher in energy and less tightly
          held than the 3s² electron removed from Mg. Subshell structure (3s vs
          3p) causes this exception to the general trend.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h3>3. Nitrogen vs. Oxygen</h3>
        <p>IE of N = 14.5 eV; IE of O = 13.5 eV.</p>
        <p class="question">
          a) Based on the trend, should the IE of O be higher or lower than N?
        </p>
        <p><strong>Trend prediction:</strong> O should be higher (to the right of N).</p>

        <p class="question">b) Explain the actual numbers.</p>
        <p>
          The actual IE of O is lower. Nitrogen has a half-filled p sublevel
          (3 electrons in 3 p orbitals), which is especially stable. Oxygen has
          one paired electron in a p orbital; electron–electron repulsion makes
          it easier to remove that electron. As a result, O has a slightly lower
          ionization energy than N.

      <h2>Part 2 – Reactivity of Metals Investigation</h2>

      <h3>Key Principle: Single Replacement Reactions</h3>
      <p>
        A metal will replace another metal in solution only if it is more
        reactive (higher in the activity series). If a reaction occurs, the
        solid metal is more reactive than the metal ion in solution.
      </p>

      <h3>Expected Reaction Patterns with Metal Nitrates</h3>
      <p>
        Using a standard activity series, the reactions with various metal
        nitrates can be summarized qualitatively as:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>More reactive metals</strong> (like Mg, Zn, Fe) displace less reactive metal ions from solution.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Less reactive metals</strong> (like Cu, Pb) do not react when placed in solutions of more reactive metal ions.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Using the Lab to Compare Reactivity</h3>
      <p class="question">
        1. How can a single replacement reaction with a metal nitrate show which
        metal is more reactive?
      </p>
      <p>
        If metal A placed into a solution of metal B nitrate causes a reaction
        (metal B solid forms), then metal A is more reactive than metal B.
        No reaction means metal A is less reactive than metal B.
      </p>

      <p class="question">
        2. Order of metal reactivity based on the test results (solid metal vs.
        metal nitrate solutions).
      </p>
      <p><strong>Order from most to least reactive:</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Mg &gt; Zn &gt; Fe &gt; Sn &gt; Pb &gt; Cu</strong></p>

      <h3>Metals in Acid</h3>
      <p class="question">
        3. Which of the tested metals are more reactive than hydrogen?
      </p>
      <p>
        Metals that react with acid to produce hydrogen gas are above H in the
        activity series:
      </p>
      <p><strong>Mg, Ca, Zn, Fe, Sn</strong></p>

      <p class="question">
        4. Rank the metals tested in acid from most to least reactive.
      </p>
      <p>
        Considering typical reactions with acid, an approximate order is:
      </p>
      <p><strong>Ca &gt; Mg &gt; Zn &gt; Fe &gt; Sn &gt; Pb &gt; Cu</strong></p>

      <p class="question">
        5. Combine the results from both parts (metal nitrates and acid) into a
        single activity series that also includes hydrogen.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Overall combined series (most to least reactive):</strong>
      </p>
      <p><strong>Mg &gt; Ca &gt; Zn &gt; Fe &gt; Sn &gt; Pb &gt; Cu</strong></p>
      <p>Hydrogen is located between Sn and Pb.</p>

      <h3>Comparing to the Standard Activity Series</h3>
      <p class="question">
        6. How does your list compare to the usual activity series on a periodic
        table or reference chart?
      </p>
      <p>
        It should agree with the common activity series:
        <em
          >K &gt; Ca &gt; Na &gt; Mg &gt; Al &gt; Zn &gt; Fe &gt; Ni &gt; Sn &gt;
          Pb &gt; H &gt; Cu &gt; Ag &gt; Au</em
        >. The metals used in the lab fit in at the same relative positions,
        confirming the trend.
      </p>

      <h3>Why Lead Sometimes Appears Not to React</h3>
      <p class="question">
        7. Lead does not seem to react in acid in the lab, but according to the
        activity series it should. Why?
      </p>
      <p>
        Lead can start to react with acid, but it forms an insoluble coating of
        compounds like PbSO₄ or PbCl₂ on its surface. This layer blocks further
        contact between the metal and the acid, so bubbling stops and it appears
        that no reaction is occurring.
      </p>

      <h3>Molecular Explanation of Reactivity: Ca vs. Mg vs. Na</h3>
      <p class="question">
        8. On a molecular level, why do Ca, Mg, and Na show different
        reactivities?
      </p>
      <p>
        Reactivity of metals depends on how easily they lose valence electrons.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Calcium (Ca):</strong> Has two valence electrons and relatively low
          ionization energy in its group. It readily loses electrons to form
          Ca²⁺, so it reacts very vigorously with acid.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Magnesium (Mg):</strong> Also forms Mg²⁺ but has a slightly higher
          ionization energy than Ca, so it reacts strongly but somewhat less
          violently.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Sodium (Na):</strong> Has one valence electron and is extremely
          reactive with water. In typical solid-metal/acid setups, its behaviour
          differs because of how it is handled, but in general Na’s very low
          ionization energy makes it highly reactive.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In summary, lower ionization energy and easier loss of electrons mean
        higher metallic reactivity.
