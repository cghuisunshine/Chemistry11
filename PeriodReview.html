  <h2>Answer Key</h2>

  <section id="atomic-radius">
    <h3>Part 1 &mdash; Periodic Trends</h3>
    <h4>Atomic Radius</h4>

    <p><strong>1.</strong> Atomic radius of Ca = 197 pm.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>a.</strong> Radius of Sc would be <strong>smaller</strong>.</li>
      <li><strong>b.</strong> Radius of Sr would be <strong>bigger</strong>.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>2.</strong> Li = 145 pm, Be = 112 pm.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>a.</strong> Bohr diagrams: Li has 2 shells + 1 valence electron; Be has 2 shells + 2 valence electrons.</li>
      <li><strong>b.</strong> Be has a higher nuclear charge, pulling the electrons in closer, so Be has the <strong>smaller radius</strong>.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>3.</strong> F = 73 pm, Cl = 99 pm.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Cl has an extra energy level (more shells) than F, so Cl has the <strong>larger radius</strong>, and F the <strong>smaller radius</strong>.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>4.</strong> Radii of Fe, Co, Ni = 126, 125, 124 pm.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Core notation electron configurations:</strong></li>
      <ul>
        <li>Fe: <code>[Ar] 4s² 3d⁶</code></li>
        <li>Co: <code>[Ar] 4s² 3d⁷</code></li>
        <li>Ni: <code>[Ar] 4s² 3d⁸</code></li>
      </ul>
      <li>The decrease in radius is very small because electrons are being added to the <strong>same 3d sublevel</strong>. The increase in nuclear charge is largely offset by extra shielding, so the size changes only slightly.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>5.</strong> Radii of Ni, Cu, Zn = 124, 128, 138 pm.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Core notation electron configurations:</strong></li>
      <ul>
        <li>Ni: <code>[Ar] 4s² 3d⁸</code></li>
        <li>Cu: <code>[Ar] 4s¹ 3d¹⁰</code></li>
        <li>Zn: <code>[Ar] 4s² 3d¹⁰</code></li>
      </ul>
      <li>According to the simple trend, the radius should keep decreasing across the period, but from Ni to Zn it actually <strong>increases</strong>.</li>
      <li>Once the 3d sublevel is full, additional protons and the way the 4s and 3d electrons shield each other cause the effective nuclear attraction on the outer electrons to change, leading to a larger radius for Zn.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section id="ionization-energy">
    <h4>Ionization Energy</h4>

    <p><strong>1.</strong> Ionization energy (IE) of Na = 5.12 eV.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>a.</strong> IE of Mg would be <strong>higher</strong> (Mg has higher nuclear charge and smaller radius).</li>
      <li><strong>b.</strong> IE of K would be <strong>lower</strong> (K is larger; its outer electron is farther from the nucleus).</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>2.</strong> IE of Mg = 7.61 eV; IE of Al = 5.95 eV.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>a.</strong> Based on the general trend across a period, IE of Al should be <strong>higher</strong> than that of Mg.</li>
      <li><strong>b.</strong> In reality, Al has the lower IE because its outer electron is in a 3p orbital, which is higher in energy and more shielded than the 3s electrons in Mg. It is therefore easier to remove.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>3.</strong> IE of N = 14.5 eV; IE of O = 13.5 eV.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>a.</strong> Trend predicts that O should have a higher IE than N, but actually O has the <strong>lower</strong> IE.</li>
      <li><strong>b.</strong> In oxygen, one of the p orbitals has a pair of electrons. The electron-electron repulsion in this pair makes it easier to remove one, lowering O's first ionization energy relative to N.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Part 1: Metals with Metal Nitrates</h4>

    <p><strong>Rule:</strong> A metal will displace another metal from solution only if it is <strong>more reactive</strong> (higher in the activity series).</p>

    <p><strong>Q1.</strong> How can you use a single replacement reaction with a metal nitrate to compare reactivity?</p>
    <p>If a solid metal displaces another metal from its nitrate solution (a reaction occurs), the solid metal is <strong>more reactive</strong> than the dissolved metal ion.</p>

    <p><strong>Q2.</strong> Reactivity order from these tests (most to least):</p>
    <p><strong>Na &gt; Mg &gt; Zn &gt; Fe &gt; Sn &gt; Pb &gt; Cu</strong></p>
  </section>

  <section id="metals-in-acid">
    <h4>Part 2: Metals in Acid</h4>

    <p>Expected observations with acid (H⁺):</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Mg &mdash; vigorous reaction</li>
      <li>Zn &mdash; strong reaction</li>
      <li>Fe &mdash; moderate reaction</li>
      <li>Sn &mdash; slow reaction</li>
      <li>Pb &mdash; no visible reaction (after an initial brief one, if any)</li>
      <li>Cu &mdash; no reaction</li>
      <li>Ca &mdash; very vigorous reaction (if tested)</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Q1.</strong> Which metals are more reactive than hydrogen?</p>
    <p><strong>Ca, Mg, Zn, Fe, Sn</strong> (they react with acid to produce H₂ gas).</p>

    <p><strong>Q2.</strong> Rank the metals in terms of their reactivity in acid (most to least):</p>
    <p><strong>Ca &gt; Mg &gt; Zn &gt; Fe &gt; Sn &gt; Pb &gt; Cu</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Q3.</strong> Combine rankings from metal nitrate tests and acid tests (including H):</p>
    <p><strong>Mg &gt; Ca &gt; Zn &gt; Fe &gt; Sn &gt; Pb &gt; H &gt; Cu</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Q4.</strong> Comparison to standard activity series:</p>
    <p>The experimental series matches the usual activity series trend: reactive metals (like Mg, Ca) on top; less reactive metals (like Pb, Cu) near the bottom.</p>

    <p><strong>Q5.</strong> Why does Pb not seem to react with acid even though it is above hydrogen in the activity series?</p>
    <p>Lead can start reacting with acid, but the reaction quickly forms an <strong>insoluble coating</strong> of lead salts (such as PbSO₄ or PbCl₂). This layer blocks further contact between the metal and the acid, so it appears that no reaction is occurring.</p>

    <p><strong>Q6.</strong> Molecular explanation for the reactivity of Ca, Mg, and Na:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Calcium (Ca):</strong> Has relatively low ionization energy for its valence electrons and forms Ca²⁺ readily, so it reacts very vigorously.</li>
      <li><strong>Magnesium (Mg):</strong> Slightly higher ionization energy than Ca, so it still reacts strongly but not quite as violently.</li>
      <li><strong>Sodium (Na):</strong> Has one valence electron and is extremely reactive with water; its behavior with acid depends on form and conditions, but in general its low ionization energy makes it highly reactive.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Overall, differences in reactivity are explained by differences in <strong>ionization energy</strong>, <strong>shielding</strong>, and how easily each metal forms ions in solution.</p>
